# Hinglish-Translation-Assignment
# Introduction:
This repository contains the code for a Hinglish translation project. The project's goal is to translate English text to Hinglish, making it sound natural and easy to understand for non-native Hindi speakers.
# Getting Started

# Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python
- Libraries (googletrans, ai4bharath-transliteration, and Sanskrit text)
# Installation
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/hinglish-translation.git
# Additional Information
# Translation:
Translation involves converting text from one language to another while preserving the meaning and context. In my assignment, we are translating English text into Hindi. For example, translating "Hello" to "नमस्ते" preserves the greeting's meaning. Translating text from English to Hinglish can be considered a form of translation. Hinglish is a hybrid language that combines elements of both English and Hindi, making it easier to understand for speakers who are familiar with both languages.
# Transliteration:
Transliteration involves converting the characters of one script into another script without changing the underlying language's meaning. In , my assignment, I have transliterated Hindi script into Romanized script(Hinglish). For example, transliterating "नमस्ते" to "namaste" preserves the pronunciation but changes the script.

# Dataset
This assignment uses a dataset of Hindi-English word pairs for translation. I have used a Hindi-English dataset with 1 lakh words.
# Conclusion:
To achieve the desired output where Hindi and English words are mixed together(Hinglish), need to create a transliteration map that includes common English words transliterated into Hinglish. However, creating such a map manually for a large number of words can be impractical. One approach is to use pre-existing transliteration libraries or models that can transliterate English words into Hinglish. 
Expanding the 'transliteration_map' to cover more common words for Hinglish transliteration, can add more key-value pairs to the dictionary.
