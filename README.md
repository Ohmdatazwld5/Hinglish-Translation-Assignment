# Hinglish-Translation-Assignment
# Introduction:
This repository contains the code for a Hinglish translation project. The project's goal is to translate English text to Hinglish, making it sound natural and easy to understand for non-native Hindi speakers.
# Getting Started

# Prerequisites

- Python
- Libraries (googletrans, ai4bharath-transliteration, and Sanskrit text)
# Installation
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/hinglish-translation.git
